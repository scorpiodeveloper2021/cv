  <p>My name is Cherie Gray. I currently reside in Arizona. I started learning web development in 2020. I started taking it seriously around 2021.
    I enjoyed being able to build something from scrach and make it look good as well as have some functionality to it. I also realized you could make a pretty decent living at it.
    Who doesn't want to get paid doing what you love? I started learning by self teaching. I did not want to go and spend thousands on a computer science degree.
    I then found out about bootcamps and took a course and it was very helpful in teching me the foundations. I'm also a licensed Health Insurance Agent and a wanabe poker pro.</p>
